# Technical test for Android

This test app consists of a list of players, and their data.

. This test should be design with latest version of Xcode and for latest version of Android.
1. The app should have these basic screens:
    - [Main screen](#main-screen) (list of players)
2. The code follows MVVM
3. Use of REST services (for fetching data)

## Main screen

The first screen to show is a table of users, fetched from resource of [JSONFormatUrl](https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/).

Allow filter data and print a list of all players
whose height in inches adds up or are greater to the integer input to the application (search box has functionality to only allow digits (inputs such as . , - or letters will show an error in list - format error handler))
